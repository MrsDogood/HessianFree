# HessianFree
I'm trying to understand HF optimization, so I'm creating a repo to experiment in.

## Building
This project depends on Maven and Make and only builds in Linux at the moment.
Run the ./build.sh script.

## Example
You'll find an example for this project in 
`src/main/java/com/github/mrsdogood/example/Main.java`.
I know that's a long file path; I hate maven conventions too.
The example can be compiled and executed with the command:

    mvn compile exec:java
